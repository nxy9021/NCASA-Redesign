                            Medical advocacy is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at hospital emergency rooms. 
                            Whenever a survivor presents at the hospital for treatment, the hospital calls our hotline and we send an advocate out to sit with the survivor. 
                            The advocate offers emotional support, provides information on sexual violence, and gives any necessary referrals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Legal advocacy is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week wherever needed. 
                                Advocates can support a survivor at the police department, or help a survivor with a case that is currently being prosecuted. 
                                Our staff advocate is very knowledgeable about court proceedings and Illinois law.
