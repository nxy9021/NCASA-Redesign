                                    <li>Survivors will be given medication to prevent any sexually transmitted infections from occurring due to the assault.</li>

                                        <li>The evidence collection kit process has many steps to it. Some of these steps include collecting oral and vaginal swabs.</li>
                                        <li>Survivors have the right to consent to any part or all of the evidence collection kit.</li>

                                If survivors do think they will be completing an evidence collection kit at the hospital, survivors should not shower, take a bath, douche, go to the bathroom, or change their clothes before the collection is complete. 
                                All of these acts can lead to loss of evidence of the assault. 
                                When survivors seek treatment for an assault at the emergency room, they should know that the police will be called because a crime has been committed.

                                        An advocate from Northwest CASA can assist survivors with this process.

                                        Survivors can report to the police if they seek medical attention at a hospital, or survivors can go to the police department of the city where the assault occurred.

                                While filing a police report, the investigating officer will ask for a summary of the assault, including where and when the assault happened. 
                                Survivors may talk to both patrolling officers as well as detectives. 
                                Survivors will be asked to give a description of the perpetrator.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                Survivors may be asked to look at photographs of known sex offenders, and/or work with a police artist to create a composite sketch of the perpetrator.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                Photographs may be taken of survivors if there are bruises or signs of attack.

                        </li>

                                The police may collect evidence at the scene of the assault as well. Survivors or anyone else should not remove anything from the crime scene.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                If charges are pressed, the legal process can take a very long time. Northwest CASA can also provide survivors with an advocate to attend court with or for survivors.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                Legal involvement can be a long, emotional, and complex process. That is why Northwest CASA can provide an advocate who can help survivors through this process.
                            </p>

                                Survivors should not be afraid to ask questions when speaking with the police, detectives, or a state’s attorney.
